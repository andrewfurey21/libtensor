# libtensor

A small tensor library with autodifferentiation for deep learning.

This library has no dependencies, it's written from scratch in C.

## Features

- [ ] tensor
- [ ] backwards mode autodifferentiation
- [ ] ops (add, mul, sum, convs, batchnorms, relu, linears, cce, maxpools)
- [ ] adam optimizer

## Examples

- [ ] mnist (relu, linear, batchnorms, cce, maxpools, convs)
