# libtensor

A small tensor library with autodifferentiation for deep learning.

This library has no dependencies, it's written from scratch in C.

## Features

- [ ] tensor struct: shape, strides, views
- [ ] backwards mode autograd
- [ ] ops (convs, batchnorms, relu, linears, cce, maxpools)
- [ ] adam optimizer

## Examples

- [ ] mnist (relu, linear, batchnorms, cce, maxpools, convs)
