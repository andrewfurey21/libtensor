# libtensor

A small tensor library with automatic differentiation for deep learning.

This library has no dependencies, it's written from scratch in C.

## current features

- [x] tensor
- [x] backwards mode autodifferentiation
- [ ] ops
    - [x] add
    - [x] mul
    - [x] sum along an axis
    - [x] relu
    - [ ] linear layer
    - [ ] flatten
    - [ ] max pool
    - [ ] conv
    - [ ] batch norm
    - [ ] sparse categorical cross entropy
- [ ] adam optimizer

## Examples

- [ ] MNIST handwritten digit recognition

## future ideas

- [ ] different backend (opencl, vulkan, cuda, metal)
